  content: `
    <p>In a world of late-night coding and caffeine, the idea of waking up early can feel alien. But many successful developers swear by structured morning routines.</p>
    <h2>The Benefits of Morning Routines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Better focus and mental clarity</li>
      <li>Dedicated time for learning and reflection</li>
      <li>Improved physical and mental health</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Whether it's journaling, exercising, or simply drinking coffee in peace, morning rituals can set a powerful tone for your entire day.</p>
    <blockquote>“Win the morning, win the day.”</blockquote>
    <p>Start small. Wake up 15 minutes earlier tomorrow and build from there.</p>
